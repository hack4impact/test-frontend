      q: "What is the University Chapter Incubation Program?",
      a: "The CIP (Chapter Incubation Program) is a two step program. The first is a six week bootcamp during the upcoming semester, and second is the following semester where incubating chapters will build software for their first time in their local communities. Hack4Impact knows starting a chapter is hard. We created the Chapter Incubation Program to help founders learn about the hardships of building software for nonprofit organizations. You can learn more about the program here.",

      q: "Why Hack4Impact?",

With our experience, we believe we can help you do good faster, easier, and morally conscious to make sure you are truly having an impact.",
